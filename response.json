Our model harnesses the strengths of multiple LSMs, each designed to capture the temporal patterns of a specific data modality. This temporal information is then added to the raw data to create a composite representation that encompasses both the multimodal and the longitudinal aspects of the data. We demonstrate the performance of our approach on a real-world dataset that contains clinical, cognitive, and genetic modalities with the aim of predicting the Ultra-High Risk (UHR) status in individuals, six months in advance. Our results show that the Mosaic LSM outperforms traditional machine learning models, achieving an outstanding Matthew's Correlation Coefficient of 0.84 and prediction accuracy of 92.4%. Overall, our work highlights the potential of Mosaic LSM as a powerful tool for disease prognosis, and its ability to leverage both the multimodality and temporality of the data to improve performance.","editable":true,"isNew":true,"img":"http://47.113.221.19:3001/9c24ddd30b5d607f0fe19fd08.png","category":"a","url":"http://47.113.221.19:3001/9c24ddd30b5d607f0fe19fd07.png"},{"key":"3","time":"2022","title":"B.

Research\naddressing this problem has sought ways to leverage weak supervi\u0002sion sources, such as the user-defined heuristic labelling functions\nused in the data programming paradigm, which are cheaper and\neasier to acquire. Automatic generation of these functions can make\ndata programming even more efficient and effective. However, ex\u0002isting approaches rely on initial supervision in the form of small\nlabelled datasets or interactive user feedback. In this paper, we\npropose Witan, an algorithm for generating labelling functions\nwithout any initial supervision. This flexibility affords many interac\u0002tion modes, including unsupervised dataset exploration before the\nuser even defines a set of classes. Experiments in binary and multi\u0002class classification demonstrate the efficiency and classification\naccuracy of Witan compared to alternative labelling approaches.","editable":true,"isNew":true,"img":"http://47.113.221.19:3001/9c24ddd30b5d607f0fe19fd07.png","category":"a"},{"key":"4","time":"test","title":"test","description":"test","editable":true,"isNew":true,"img":"http://47.113.221.19:3001/9c24ddd30b5d607f0fe19fd09.png","category":"b"},{"key":"5","time":"2023","title":"ux-for-beginners-a-crash-course-in-100-short-lessons","description":"There are many books about UX but few dare to take on the entire spectrum of UX \nwork.
